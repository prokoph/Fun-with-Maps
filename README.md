# Fun with Maps
A playground for making maps

## International Cosmic Day (ICD)
In order to plot the location of the ICD participants each year, some code snippets can be found in the subdirectory code. The notebook named "International Cosmic Day" basically plots the World map or a map of Europe while the notebook "Globe" tries (with moderate success) to make an animated version of it.
